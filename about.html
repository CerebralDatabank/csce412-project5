        <p>I am a sophomore at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. I am also a self-taught computer programmer and web developer. Computers are my passion and I spend a lot of my free time coming up with new and clever ways to create new programs and websites that further my knowledge and help me develop my creative ideas.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Flower Mound, Texas and was (and still am) a voracious reader growing up. My hobbies range from fact to fiction books, video game soundtracks to fan music, and retro games to VR.</p>
        <p>The elegant complexity of computers fascinates me - billions of individual parts working in tandem toward a common goal. Software is a great equalizer for human advancement, offering opportunities for limitless learning and growth. Almost anyone with a device and freely available information can learn how to create something that has a lasting impact on the world. My goal is to lead a business that develops game-changing technological innovations that benefit all individuals and improves communities.</p>
        <p>I have also spent time working on projects like my Homeowner's Association website and have made contributions to multiple open-source projects via platforms like GitHub. My preferred programming languages are HTML/CSS/JavaScript, C++, and Java, but I also try to learn about new languages and programming environments as they emerge.</p>
        <p>I also spent a lot of time on my personal website, which serves as an outlet for my creativity. I have lots of retro games ranging from the simple to devilishly difficult, programming snippets, fact generators, a full-fledged web-based operating system (with a complete desktop!) that you can run in your browser, as well as utilities like a statistical analyzer, an assembly emulator, graphing calculator and more! My personal website also houses my blog, which can help you learn a (possibly useful) thing or two about coding, games, and my other interests.</p>
